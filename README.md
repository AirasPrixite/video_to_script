# video_to_script
The demo.py is the main code file. It contains all the helper functions and main model for script generation. 

Here is how you can set up the system: 
1. Install the requirements.text file in a local environment. This can be done by running: 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Copy the path to the video you wish to test the system with. 
3. Add the path to the line 15 of the file video_to_audio.py. 
4. Execute the file by using the command: 
    python video_to_audio.py
5. Copy the path of the audio generated by the script above. 
6. Add that path to line 532 of the file demo.py. 
7. Execute the file by using the command: 
    python demo.py
8. You will see a text file generated in the same directory with the script of the video.
